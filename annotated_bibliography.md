Ohtsuki, H., Hauert, C., Lieberman, E., & Nowak, M. A. (2006). A simple rule for the evolution of cooperation on graphs. Nature, 441(7092), 502.

Ohtsuki, Hauert and Lieberman are motivated from that cooperation is the property of all biological system. They propose the simple graph model in which natural selection prefers cooperation in the certain condition. They assume vertice are divided into two types, cooperators who pay a cost for neighbos to receive a benefit and defectors who only receive benefits from cooperators. They simulate for various graph types(cycle, lattice, random regular graph, random graph and scale-free network) and find the conditon that cooperators spread throughout the graph. They find that the fewer connections, the more cooperation in their model.

Axelrod and Douglas argue that evolution can produce cooperation as a trait, even in situations where defection is a dominant strategy in a non-iterated version of the situation. They expand on the prisoners dilemma tournament model used in Axelrods original tournament to incorporate evolutionary aspects. In the new model automata are constructed from a set of instructions, and then they interact with other automata as is the case in the older model. However, in addition to altering the population of each type of automata, the automata exchange instructions (chromosomes) or randomly alter a single instruction (mutation). Axelrod and Douglas conclude that cooperation can emerge from randomized evolution.

Santos and Pacheco find that cooperation becomes dominating features in scale-free networks unlike regualr graphs. They adopt the prisoner's dilemma and snowdrift game to research cooperation. As the correlation between individuals becomes bigger, the cooperation emerges throughout the entire population. They simulate the graph from small network with 100 individuals to very large population.

Masuda and Aihara simulate an iterated prisoners dilemma with automata that interact only if they are connected on a graph. They simulate this on different types of networks, including regular graphs, lattices, and small-world networks. They find that small world networks produce cooperation to the greatest extent. They also investigate the effects of noise on the system, and consider the robustness of cooperation on the different networks.
