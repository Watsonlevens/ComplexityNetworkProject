## Review of *Modeling Mortality and Transmission of the Black Plague*

**Changjun Lim**


### Question
What does a SIR model stand for? It is necessary to explain them. 

I understand what you are doing, but it is unclear what question you are trying to answer. 

### Methodology
The model you simulate is not explained in detail. What exactly transmission between cities means? How many people are infected if the plague is transmitted? What does reinfection mean?

### Results
It is easy to understand the meaning of Figure 2 and 3.

Is it possible to have the negative degree centrality? I think you do not need to have a negative range for degree centrality in Figure 2.

What is the unit for reinfections? Is it measured in a city?

The shapes of figures are inconsistent.

In Figure 3, the legend and the title are quite small and there is no label for x and y-axis. The colors for infected and dead so similar that it is hard for me to distinguish them at first sight.

### Interpretation
The interpretations of Figure 2 and 4 are not enough.

### Replication
The network replicating the original paper has the similar properties and tendency with the original one. 

### Extension
The approach to make the model elaborate is clear and proper.

### Progress
I think the direction you choose is proper.

### Presentation
It looks good to use an active voice.

The meanings of some words are unclear(like three parameters). The explanation about terms is insufficient.

### Mechanics
The hyperlink for OWTRAD dataset is good.

The captions of Figure 2 and Figure 4 are truncated

There is no bibliography.
