1) Explain SIR model. Is it apropriate(pandemic model with reinfection but without resistance)?

2) OWTRAD? Please explain.

3) Question: what is the point? It seems like you are just adding a feature to a model, not answering any new questions.

4) Improve markdown for figure captions.

5) Historical data for reference?

6) Size of graphs/figures varies a lot

7) Need more interpretation of figure 2

8) How is degree centrality measured? please define your metric

9) Replication: Seems OK, it would be nice if you could provide some of the actual data/figures found in the original research.

10) Is it feasable to ignore the reactions of cities as the plague goes on? Shouldn't trade and pilgramiges reduce when a city is mostly dead? Was this included in the original model (I know this is taken into account inside the cities via the SIR model, but is it considered outside)?

11) ADD A BIBLIOGRAPHY - CITING SOURCES IS IMPORTANT

12) Progress: Seems OK, unless you are going to need to do a lot of additional work to finish the extension.

13) Methodology: You don't explain the methodology for city interactions quantitatively. Please explain.

14) Your model shows pretty much all of Europe dead. This obviously did not actually happen (I think it was around 1/3 dead). Please explain (I assume it is a result of no resistance or recovery in the SIR model).

15) Your method of choosing cities? You said that it was different from the original experiment, but you did not explain your process. Was it random? Did you just use all the available data?

16) I don't see any explanation of your motivation.

17) Presentation:
