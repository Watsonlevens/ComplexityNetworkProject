### The Effect of Clustering on the Emergence of Cooperation in the Spatial Prisoner's Dilemma

Noah Rivkin, Changjun Lim

Abstract:

We attempted to reprodece and expand opun the findings of Masuda and Aihara[1]. Masuda and Aihara's work examines the spatial prisoners dilemma on small world graphs. They found that cooperative behavior emerged in a wide range of conditions. When we replicated their experiment we found qualitatively similar results, but under a smaller range of conditions. We also expanded on their original work by incorporating additional types of small world graphs. They had used only Watts-Strogatz[2] type graphs, while we tested Holmes-Kim graphs[3]. Masuda and Aihara suggest that their work may suggest why small-world networks are so prevalent in society. They also suggest that one reason why cooperation does not always dominate could be that the rewards for defection are too high. Our analysis suggests that their results do not hold under preferentialy attachment, which provides an additional explanation for real world examples where cooperation is not dominant.
